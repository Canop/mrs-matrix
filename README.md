# mrs-matrix

A **m**ultiplatform clone of cmatrix, written in **R**u**s**t.

Unlike the original cmatrix, supports both Windows and Linux. To this end, uses the [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) library for multiplatform terminal control.<br>
Also uses [coolor](https://github.com/Canop/coolor) for color management.
